# Synthesis Mode

You have gathered information (from interviews, research, exploration). Now synthesize it into actionable insights.

## Synthesis Process

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- What themes keep coming up?
- What surprises emerged?
- What contradictions exist?

### 2. Key Insights
Extract the 3-5 most important insights:
- Each insight should be non-obvious
- Each should change how we think about the problem
- Frame as "[Discovery] means [Implication]"

### 3. User Mental Model
How do users think about this problem?
- What's their vocabulary?
- What's their existing framework?
- What are their assumptions?

### 4. Problem Hierarchy
Rank the problems/needs discovered:
1. **Must solve**: Deal breakers, core pain
2. **Should solve**: Significant but not critical
3. **Nice to solve**: Delighters, extras

### 5. Tensions and Trade-offs
What competing needs exist?
- Speed vs. accuracy
- Simplicity vs. power
- Familiar vs. innovative

### 6. Hypotheses to Test
Based on synthesis, what do we believe?
- "We believe [hypothesis]..."
- "We'll know we're right if [signal]..."
- "We'll know we're wrong if [signal]..."

## Output Format

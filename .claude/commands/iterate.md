# Iteration Mode

You've built something. Now let's evaluate and iterate.

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Does it solve the problem?
- Refer back to the context doc if available
- Is this addressing the actual pain point?
- Would the user recognize their problem in this solution?

### 2. Does it handle the edge cases that matter?
- Not all edge cases, the ones that matter
- What happens when things go wrong?
- What about the 80% use case?

### 3. Ship or iterate?
- Is this good enough to ship?
- Or is it just "technically works"?
- What's the gap between the two?

## Iteration Options

### A. Refine This Direction
"It's right but needs polish"
- What specifically needs to change?
- Is it UX, visual, functionality?

### B. Pivot the Approach
"It's not quite right"
- What did we learn about why it's not right?
- What alternative approach should we try?

### C. Go Deeper
"It's surface level"
- What's missing from the solution?
- What would make this a 10/10?

### D. Ship It
"It's good enough"
- What's the next step to production?
- What's the plan for learning from real usage?

## Output

After evaluation, provide:
1. **Assessment**: Which of the above categories does this fall into?
2. **Specific Feedback**: Concrete things to change or keep
3. **Next Action**: Exactly what to do next

**What to evaluate:** $ARGUMENTS

Let me look at what we've built and evaluate against the original intent.

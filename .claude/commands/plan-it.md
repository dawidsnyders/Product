# Ultrathink Planning Mode

**IMPORTANT**: Use extended thinking for this task. Think deeply and thoroughly.

You are now in strategic planning mode. Take all the context that has been gathered and transform it into an actionable plan.

## Your Approach

ultrathink about this problem. Consider:

1. **Problem Clarity**: Is the problem well-defined enough to solve? If not, what's still ambiguous?

2. **Solution Space Exploration**: What are 2-3 fundamentally different approaches to this problem? Don't converge too early.

3. **Trade-off Analysis**: For each approach, what are the trade-offs? What do you gain? What do you lose?

4. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong? What assumptions are we making? What needs validation?

5. **Sequencing**: What should be built first to learn the most? What's the minimum viable experiment?

## Output Structure

### Problem Statement
A crisp 2-3 sentence articulation of what we're solving and for whom.

### Context Summary
Key constraints, what good looks like, what's been tried.

### Approaches Considered
| Approach | Pros | Cons | Risk Level |
|----------|------|------|------------|
| A: ... | ... | ... | ... |
| B: ... | ... | ... | ... |
| C: ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Recommended Path
Which approach and why. Be specific about the reasoning.

### Implementation Plan
Break down into concrete phases:

**Phase 1: Validate** (if needed)
- What experiments or prototypes to run first
- What questions need answers before building

**Phase 2: Build Core**
- The essential features/components
- Technical architecture decisions
- Integration points

**Phase 3: Iterate**
- What to add based on learnings
- Success metrics to watch

### Prototype Opportunities
Specific prototypes that could be built to test ideas:
- Figma mockups needed
- Interactive prototypes (Motion.dev, code)
- User testing approach

### Open Questions
Things that still need answers before or during building.

### Next Immediate Action
The single most important next step.
